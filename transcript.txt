 Page? Shelvin? You know him? Yeah, I know we go way back. What are you doing here? Would you believe me if I told you I was working on a thimto-second laser in the engineering department? Yes. And that? You know she's not old enough to be here. I'm not old enough to drink beer. Yeah, it was. Did I convince you the drinking is wrong? Good for me. Just leave me alone. What are you doing here? I'm trying to have fun and I don't want them to know how old I am. Why? Because I want them to think that I'm cool. But you're smart. What's cool in that? Just go away. Hey, we're fixing to play some beer pong you in. You should know she is not... Not had dinner. I have not had dinner yet, so we are going to get some food. We are? You have cash? Of course. I always have an emergency 20 plus 4 quarters to the telephone. 21 bucks, like a year buying. We're going the wrong way. Hey, well, I'm drunk. You lead. Are you still in the re-added or can we have an intelligent conversation? No. You do realize that alcohol kills brain cells. But it also makes life tolerable. What do you mean? Well, talking to you is usually annoying. It's you who's called a mean drunk, noted. I'm messing with you. It's just sometimes life sucks and it's easier not to deal with it. Could you be more specific? Um... Well, I have no friends. I don't fit in anywhere and I dropped out of college, but I'm too young to get a job, so... Cullen brain cells makes it easier. Huh. Go ahead, smart guy. Fix me. Hmm. Well, give me a minute. I'm assuming you haven't taken the dare pledge. The what? Dare, right? It's an acronym. It stands for Drug Abuse Resistment Situcation. It's not too late. You can take it now. I promise not to do drugs to avoid violence, to be responsible, and to make responsible choices. Now you say it. No. I dare you. Clever, right? Because I still have all my brain cells. Cullen, just eat your pizza. Hey! You guys go and do a party? Uh, damn a cap of house. Cool. Hmm. You know, Officer McDaniel was in charge of our dare program. One time he even brought in his drug-sniffing dog, Alfie, which I didn't care for, but it was nice to see a dog gainfully employed now. What are we doing here? It's a party, Sheldon. But we weren't invited, and I didn't bring a gift. Then we go home. Wait, this is dangerous. There I stood. The classic hero outside the dragon's cave. Should I risk life and limb to save the maiden? My every instinct said no. But I drink a lot of root beer and really had to go pee pee. Excuse me. I'm looking for my friend, blonde girl, about a meter and a half. Excuse me. I'm looking for a... Missy? Sheldon? What are you doing here? What are you doing here? Your mom and dad know you're here. Your mom and dad know you're here? Okay, stop. You go first. Heather's sister goes to school here. She invited us. Now you. I'm looking after Paige. Where is she? Well, I didn't say I was doing a great job. Paige is drunk. And hi on what Officer Reganiel's called Mary Jane, Reaper, and Don John. Is she okay? No, she said her life is terrible. What? Her life is terrible? What? My life is terrible. Her life is terrible. Now what do we do? We can't just leave. Paige is still in there. Maybe we should come home. I do have four quarters for that exact reason. Paige? Wait. What are you doing? Well, this is Bradley, and we're going to another party. Another party? It's 930. Bradley, do you know how old she is? She said she was 18. Lower. 16? Lower. I think I got to go. Thanks a lot. Come on. We're running again. We're running again.
