      " I try to probably introduce you and get started. I guess you really come from a very, probably a diverse background. She has been working for almost five years at NAMNATron, been in the industry. I have worked in a multiple company that is a front end developer over the past five or five or six years. And she recently started working on her startup. She's a co-founder of Pialist. The topic of today's discussion is discussing about what proof of work and how proof of work basically could enable developers or any individuals to basically unlock different opportunities. But it's not about making resumes or making profiles, but actually showcasing how your work actual revolves around. And who better than Yogini was building Pialist with the same motor with the same agenda and everything. So yeah, that's what Moralist, what Yogini have been doing. Anything probably Yogini you would like to add or probably want to add, feel free to do that. So yeah, I mean, so this is a good topic that because I'm building a product around it. So I'm talking on that that is one part, but on this topic, I also have a story. My career story, which is obviously very close to my heart and that is why I can be a big promoter of this topic. Right, interesting. So I guess we can start with that story itself. If you do not mind to share that in detail, that how exactly this whole thing started, why exactly I have seen that you said this enough number of 10 that there's something very close to your particular part. This is a very close to your heart topic. So yeah, probably we can begin with this whole particular part. Before beginning just one last time I request if anyone else probably could have their web cams on that would be really great for Yogini to probably have a lot of work. I have a lot more motivation to actually speak and interact with you folks also. I don't think so. You've been in I and anyone of your here want to have any boring classes type of a lecture. So you want to make it more of a interactive and a more of a discussion style kind of a thing. So feel free to put up your questions while you've been answering or while we're discussing and probably she will pick it up from there and we can continue. Okay, you're getting the stages all yours. I mean, even I would love to get interrupted and ask in the between. So we'll be happy to answer anything and thanks a lot for all the folks who have just just started the web cam. I'm actually feeling like okay, I'm talking to you. Okay, so I think I'll get started and tell a bit about me myself and why I can relate to this topic or how really showcasing your work matters. So, so you can say that I belong to if you go back to my past I belong to a three-tier city in Maharashtra. I graduated done engineering from the three-tier college. So my college is unknown my city is unknown. Then somewhere so you don't get good guidance right so that time someone told me that do the empty from the same college and the masters will help you get the job and we all have started for getting the job right. So I started doing the masters from the same college again that was might be a big mistake, but you're from the same college. Then I thought that because I'm staying in my hometown and there is no company as such. So why shouldn't I do some job or something. So while doing that I started doing lecture. I was pursuing amtik and I was doing a working as a lecturer. Simultaneously I was teaching students the programming languages like C C++, PHP and all. And I started loving PHP, but I used to get so much of time apart from my lecture. So I started getting active on the internet and through some network or through my friends. I got some freelancing projects during that time. So when I said freelancing project it was like a very basic website template like build a page in HTML CSS and bootstump back then. But it was paying my bills and I was so happy that I took I'm doing something apart from my day to day job. So that is how I started, but soon the lectureorship part was like I was getting bored and then I decided to move to some bigger city for better opportunities. So that is when I moved to Pune. But now you can understand that me applying for a developer job with the background of the college is unknown. I am coming from a lectureorship background with two years of experience. So for anybody to trust me as a developer was pretty hard. At that time the freelancing projects which I did helped me a lot because my resume wasn't speaking for me, but they were speaking for me. They were advocating me that yes, she can build, she is a developer, she can build stuff. Though in HTML CSS bootstrap, but at least she have the potential to learn and grow. So those were the freelancing projects, those were the website templates which helped me get my first job as a front end developer. And then I didn't have to like look back and because once you get in, then then stages yours who can move ahead. But that is why I said that because I had that proof of my work that yes, I have been working as a developer from past two years. It was quite easy for me to switch careers from lectureorship to the full time developer. So that's very interesting. I didn't find this particular bit anywhere about you that you did lecture ship and everything. So that is on my purely profile apart from that that is no there is no. Okay, probably I should have researched a lot more on your purely for file itself. Anyway, anyway, so probably to to kick off this whole particular part and you said that your proof of work has probably. Help you pivot from a probably go from your lectureship to this particular part, but if you look at this particular word proof of work, it's a very new word, especially in this are in this. There was nothing like this word kind of thing that was being famous and I don't think so. There's also a very famous word outside the Twitter world also. There's more or less very spoken in this particular context only at a certain level. But in a general sense, if I see the meaning of proof of work have changed a lot at a certain probably five to 10 years back, because your resume or a curriculum, by then then LinkedIn came in and get a profiles came in and everything came in now. Profiles like pay or list and other tools are basically coming in and everything one particular part, which is basically common in all these things are they help you showcase in a very easiest way to these particular aspect, right. But these are merely tools, which basically helps you showcase this particular part, but just having a good resume does not get your job right that is that one particular part. So my first part is how how traditional or how how the difference of this proof of work is basically changed instead of now in the buildings I do know in a much better way and how that showcasing part is something which is a lot I think that a lot of people do not really focus on the just have a resume to just have a profile, but do not really work on actually making that profile speak for themselves right. So yeah, that does are probably two first questions I have. So, Rinkesh, I have been like so I have seen people who have developed some pretty amazing projects, but who fail to showcase home and that is why they are like lost somewhere. So if you if you check GitHub GitHub is the best platform where you can find awesome developers who are inside projects and which which we even don't think about. So I think proof of work is important, but what equally important is promoting it promoting what you are doing right. So I remember so because as you said that because the route right now I'm in a building side of I'm hiring so I'm taking interviews I'm talking to people so that I might understand that OK, I can see that this person have a return AWS. So, so many other technologies that that that person have worked on, but how can I rely on those technologies right because all know that on the resumes how much we have like glorified what would we know. Yeah, yeah, even I mean everybody talk about LinkedIn and everybody talk about the the knowledge to share on LinkedIn and everybody say that we glorify things. Yeah, if we have return hello world in that and we say. So so in in that time when there are like 10 developers claiming to be that OK, I know react is very well you need something which will advocate for you apart from saying that I know react. Yeah, yeah, right. So I have seen people who have developed so most of the developers I have seen that they have like now because we have shifted to work from home culture as well. So, you know, people are developing so many things they are developing side projects but again, yeah. Those are like very vague so you can't find any read me to that you can't find the details that we need so I think those are the changing factors that will that will change your resume to the proof of work and will increase. That that is what I always feel because so I can tell you the incidents where I got an email from a developer that he was looking for a job change and he was looking for an internship basically so he wrote it to me and it was a very simple two three liners of email that OK, I want an internship I saw that you might have. And this is my GitHub this is my portfolio. If you can reach out to me reach out to me on you can reply to the same and that's it nothing. But I when when I checked his GitHub profile I was literally able to see every project of this done pretty nicely I was able to have it to read the whole read me that read enough to give me the idea of what project you did what was just making. Plus he also have deployed that to the course of labs where I can go and try to have and that was I didn't even ask for his resume we directly ask him for the interview. I think that is the shift which is happening that if you show case your profile well then what do you want to ask you resume I literally don't even know what he have done in his graduation which which stream he is. So yeah that is how things work when you have a solid and strong to. So I want to take this from from this whole part which you said is that rather saying I am X show that you are X right that is that is one thing that that needs to be there and another another thing which I I think a lot of developers essentially misses that they are pretty there. They might be really good at writing the good but they probably are not good at documentation right to the part which you mentioned about read me I find it so so less that people have read me is on their GitHub profile and explain and everything and as a recruiter a lot of students do not really understand how it is for me to understand the whole thought process and everything and essentially for any resume or anything which you share with us the point is to make my life easier so that I can actually get you on call or for a interview or anything right so yeah what do you think so I guess I want to touch up on this particular part that why do you think so a lot of developers miss out this particular part of documentation I've seen this with a lot of good talented folks that I'm going to talk about. I'm talented folks that they are good with writing code and everything but did they are not really good with explaining or documenting and everything and since we're moving into a remote culture this becomes even more important because rather not just showcasing while you're working with teams also this becomes very important as part of your efficiency and working culture right so to be honest writing a documentation is a part like we are deliberately trying to add in our culture that OK. Have something where we are documenting things so that because that that has become the vital role player in any any feature development so coming back to coming back to your question I think as a developer what we are trained to train to think is a developer job is headstown build. There are product managers there are product designers there are POS and other people who are taking care of the product part so what is your what is your work is to headstown build the product second so all of these developers have we all have this in mind that if it is working if it is functionally well doesn't matter how it looks doesn't matter how easy it is to use because it is working that and we have we have done our part. I think we need all of us I mean even considering me we need that the mentality shift that no we should be able to sell our own product we have to be sellers first and then developers again because then only we can do it so when we started so we started we are just as a side project really a second first thought was creating a resume builder and that is where we are right now so you can understand the journey. So if we can sell our product to customers and to investors and if every developer think of it like I have to sell my proof of work to interviewer will become an easy shift that okay for for interviewer to buy it how much details I need to put it right. So and also I have seen this becoming an extractor for me while making the decision that okay if this particular developer have made effort to deploy their app somewhere so that I can try it out to write down some readmeas for me to write down a documentation on a case study then obviously they will get that brownie points from me that okay. Yeah exactly exactly. So one particular part of this documentation thing is that there's obviously not taught at any school or college level or any I don't think so even there are specific bootcamps with specializes around like giving you this even coding bootcamps I have not seen very much I'm trying to emphasize on this but so this is not something which which is basically taken from any school to syllabus which you probably might have learned from somewhere and I guess in start of your journey as well you might have not been really good at this particular part so if anyone who is listening as a developer year and want to get better at it. How do you think so they could start what what could be those first couple of steps to get better and start documenting things beat with site projects or beat with their own portfolio or anything. So I think anything so there is the that rubber duck method which we used to solve bugs right that if you have a bug try to explain that to the some rubber duck or something and you yourself will find the solutions and that helps tremendously if you even if you try that. So I think the best way to document something is explaining how you will explain that feature particularly to somebody. Suppose there is a person sitting next to you and you have to explain whatever thought process you have gone through while building that particular thing. Try to answer those questions and and or maybe write it down first that which questions that will ask you and then try to answer those so that will that will create a best read me for you and then you will. Interesting interesting so. The another part which you mentioned before on this particular part this particular thing was you have to be you have to sell first and become a developer second right could you could you expand on that particular part because that selling part is actually the whole thing where most of the developers I see failing at. I have come across so many people are good at as a developer or as a individual whatever skills they are but are not able to showcase or they are not able to sell that and there are various aspect of it being showcasing your work online to probably having a proper crafted resume or a link or probably having a proper get up thing and everything and so as a recruiter also or as a someone who is both developer and a recruiter on the both side what do you think so there is a checklist that these are things you should you should probably do. So that everything falls apart on your particular part right so I would I would love to focus on why we should be why we should sell so the first thing is you will know so there are so many other developers who have as good skills as you have right there are so many others so what are those factors which you can improve to get 10% better than. Then your peers right so these are these will be the factors which will differentiate you from others that is one thing second if you see search on GitHub to do list will find literally 10,000 of repositories which which are to do list right so if you are building to do is make it to the level of to do is if you know the way to do is start right so these are the things then second is how you will be selling it to people or how you will be sharing sharing that to people so one important aspect I have seen is if you start sharing your work you will definitely start getting the hell I have started sharing first my projects my site projects so my senior started noticing me okay there is a there is a person in our own company and she is trying to build something so they came up they did the code reviews which I never ask for but those code reviews help me become a better developer right I posted those on LinkedIn many good developers who are building something in similar world or some ideas some feature ideas are there is out to me that you're going to you are building something really cool and these are the things you can improve or we found this bug or we found this vulnerability security vulnerability you can improve on that so these are the ways when you start sharing your product so first thing is you learn a lot because many people reach out to you to try to improve you that is second about the job perspectives so you started because recruiters also started noticing you that okay I have an opening for next year's in my company and I have seen this person building all the apps in next year so I might reach out and I might ask that are you available and when so when that comes so your first part is cracked you have made somebody reach out to you because whatever you have done now the second part is how much easy you made them to convert to have that you are a person that okay I reached out to your shop now make me your user so that is where all these extra points comes in where I said that you have you should have deployed half you should have like good read me you should have good UI like okay I should get impressed you have done some nice work maybe you are writing some article about it so that I can read both through it and understand what is your thought process and something so these are these are all the parts that will make your work not only work but it will help you out in some way to you know excel by knowledge and excel in even in the opportunities. Right interesting you mentioned this one particular thing where you said that go to get up and you will find to do list there thousands of them and I find this particular thing especially with a lot of college student that just pick up a very random or a very generic idea as a project for them self and try to shoot pieces and then say that why I didn't get a job or why I'm not getting this particular part so what do you think so as a developer or even as a recruiter how do you see the importance of these projects now now there like I think that the two major impact things which are there in the profiles for most of the developers is the site projects which have been picking up a lot now these days and the internships so these college projects or these personal project how do you how do you think so from your personal aspect also like pianist was your site project and then converting to a startup how how that particular thing should be looked up on other developers. So I think as a developer we either spend too much of time thinking about our project idea that I will or we go into the list. These are the. I think if we try to solve the realistic problem so I am so many people reach out to me asking that okay you come on site projects but we don't know which site projects to develop we are out of ideas what what I mean open Twitter you will see you can even build one single feature very tiny feature of from the Twitter your job is done right so I I was talking to one one college student and she asked me the same thing that what should be the what what I should build I say that you will see that if you if you are typing say I typed Yogi me and I said dot and without space I started typing CEO so Twitter convert that into link so can you create a rich text editor which will convert that which will convert that text into link if I if I can hide it somewhere like that right very small feature but you can create a good she made a package out of it. I mean if I am interviewing her and if I see that she have created an NPM package with this I would love to explore her explore and would love to hire her that okay right at least let me check what are what are her skillset. So I think these are these are the things we miss that we either go very hard on finding which project to do but there are so many projects floating around I mean if you see right now even on zoom you can see that there is a view which which changes from from Tile to focus yeah that is built that that can be a site project. I mean after that making some fancy creative things we can make things which are actually useful. I guess a lot of people think that you should build site projects or you should build projects which are very utility or useful kind of a thing I came across this really interesting thing that there is a trend of this going on right everyone are sharing their scores so someone just today's later of that trend made a leaderboard out of it and shared it on Twitter right and that was really good. Another thing which was which I saw recently was Spotify wrapped came in and then everyone started building Twitter app calendar wrap then everything and although they might not like be very good good things that you're picking up picking up on trend that basically might help you go viral that might help you showcase your work even to more people and basically could help you identify that yes you know your part of whatever actually doing and everything in that particular part. I've seen one more thing is that people go into this a lot of aspect of I'll build this on AI I'll build this on ML I'll build this on blockchain and everything trying to be heavy on technology rather than actually trying to showcase that. Have you have you seen that particular part. I have experienced it myself. So when we started purely so we really scratched purely score three times. So we started with like the first approach was let's go with go lang we were knowing about it just we part that is the fastest back in technology and we should go with that. So that is very started and then within 15 days we realize okay learning and implementing is not going to be the same. So let's play with the strength and that is where we pivoted and and something which we know so I think a fancier technologies will come so I was some day talking about two three days back I was talking about next day and somebody said that next year school but have you tried remix run good really good but every I mean within a month every new technologies will come. You have to be master of one and then you can be jack of all right. I will have a question. I need to have in my portfolio except from API's and all I'm not good in building you eyes and all my confusion results around this only. Share your postman collections. Sorry, I was you can you repeat. I just said share your postman collections. Actually so there is one API right Jason placeholder or something I have seen it is very popular. Or even so recently I came across this service RS is to Jason do you know that anybody. So it just converts every RS is feed to Jason so you can I mean as a backend engineer you can have so many of such services and even you can. Get paid for doing that they have like that monthly subscription for that so of course there will be they will be around backend and I think you are not that tough to understand so being a backend developer you will easily pick it up and. There is an opportunity to be a full spec. Interesting picking up from that particular thing I guess here there is a two aspect of from a student perspective if I say that I've seen a lot of people being very focused that I want to be a backend developer I want to be and what I want to be this particular part. And for them I think the selling aspect the positioning aspect becomes very stronger in a certain level but if you are let's say a jack of all trades which which most people are there especially only start in their career the positioning I keep going back to positioning word being start up. So yeah the part of showcasing your portfolio becomes difficult in a sense and a lot of time you see that the resume or the portfolio is filled with a number of skills right like you are you are probably good at 20 different other skills okay when you're trying to apply for a job so what would you suggest. That how how how pressures or how students should approach this particular thing even if they're having those skills or not and what what would be the ideal balance around this particular part. So I always have felt that you should be master it one thing doesn't matter which thing it is when I started as a developer I was hired for my CS skills. Right now it is it is not the era where people will get hired for CS skills but I was hired for my CS skills because I was so good in CS is that I was able to fix any of the CS issues any of the responsiveness issues that that used to be there right that one one being master at one so I remember on my first interview they asked me out JavaScript question. Well it was a string in 20 in a string so what will be the solution for that and I didn't do the answer that time right but still I was hired because I was very good in CS so this one will will make you win everywhere and then you can cover up for others that that you cover up for others. So in for showcasing I would definitely say that so you should have two three things which are your strong points right doesn't matter if it is a bank and or which which particular part of it whichever interest you you can just pick that up and start start from there that can be a starting point and then you can finish up the surface. Interesting okay okay probably coming back to the showcasing or selling part taking taking your example I've seen that you have been very active around writing blocks okay you have written on medium deaf to and lot of other places and everything we have a decent following on Twitter as well you have a good amount of audience on LinkedIn as well and every other aspect and everything I know for sure know that this has helped you. And probably will help you over the period of time this does not go away but as a student a lot of people think a showcasing your work today means creating content and everything in a certain aspect I don't think so when you started writing blogs or any particular medium any particular aspect you thought that okay you will be content creator as I'm creating content correct me if I'm wrong but there's a very different way to do it. There are very different ways of looking of looking at things today there buzzwords like content creation personal brand and everything that has come in I don't think that way there when you started your journey and everything but you still have those particular thing on your particular part and probably those have paid off today and build do so as a as a student or as someone who's basically just getting started how do you think so the approach should be of showcasing your work of not just right. The code but every other aspect of doing that particular part right so writing is writing have helped me tremendously with my overall journey exactly one year back 2021 January I was struggling personally so I was I thought of like I was not able to consistently do things of work and of site projects and all. So I thought of doing one experiment that posting one article a week doesn't matter what is the article doesn't matter what I'm writing technical article basically that was the technical at posting one article a week which was like quite a achievable target I guess that helped me be consistent enough in my learnings because when you have to write something down so have to be. Very very sure on writing so because I had set up that target for myself I was being very particular about what topic I'm writing about so thinking about the topic learning that if there are some learning curves around writing it down checking every fact and then publishing was like a whole process I used to go through every week. That constantly for 21 weeks which helped me a lot because that is where so I started so when I started posting my article I was not active I was not on LinkedIn I just thought of doing this experiment just to keep me accountable for my learning and for for doing my site project. So Dev2 has a Twitter handle and they share host from on their platform through that Twitter handle right so I got featured in the two three tweets. I started getting so suddenly I started getting Twitter notifications because I had back then I had like 200 around followers which were all my friends. How long back this was sorry to cut this was March 2021. Wow that is very very recent. In certain context. Very very recent. So then I started getting so many Twitter notifications which was never a case before that because I was wasn't that active on Twitter I used to tweet once in a while. Because of those Twitter notifications and those features in the practical day I understood that there is a Twitter community of techies. So tech Twitter is a thing that I need sharing knowledge and there is a huge community which is pretty good like there's some really good stuff that is started becoming active on Twitter so you can say that almost from 31st or 1st of April I started becoming very active on Twitter. And that is all the journey started so LinkedIn I it's been like two three months that I have I'm little active on LinkedIn otherwise I I was using LinkedIn just as a like just as all we use we have. So that is my journey but I think because I was I got featured that is where the things started that okay I should write more that is that is some which. Keep kept me going that yes I should because of writing I was able to be consistent I was able to learn and that helped me a lot showcasing my work that what exactly I am doing so I think writing will help you a lot in so many ways because then as I said that you have to be very particular when you are. Yes definitely definitely I guess a lot of people which I probably hear is they have this particular thought of who will read my content or who will read my articles I do not have even audience everything and I guess the first article which probably you might have also written I don't think so you might have had a very as big of audience as you have today and everything right so how do you break through I don't think so we are. So your first article would have been viral if if if it would have been you that that probably have been very good but most of the cases it doesn't happen probably you have to write consistently and after certain time you get certain audience or get featured somewhere or it basically goes viral some point my first article got nine views. That is where I from nine views to and so 26 Jan 2021 was was my first article published today I crossed three lack article use wow. So why because I posted consistently I still have that regret that I stopped posting after my article but so but yeah I mean if you keep doing things consistently one article a week work for me there might be some people who can who have the ability to write two three articles a week or maybe one article in a month or one article in two weeks. So it's different for everybody but I think keeping there consistently will help you get the result. Carthag is an interesting question how do you decide what to post. Okay so I mostly post whatever challenges I face every day as a developer we solve something some product. So on Tuesday I'm publishing on migration that we recently my from reactor next year so I'm posting about my experience while migrating that so if I integrated something some some some really nice integration or something which is very interesting I write about that mostly that is the case so that is how I decide what what to post on Twitter is like random thoughts. Yeah yeah so I think a lot of I don't think so we have this culture of sharing our work aspect a lot more at any level most people here like most people have this part that we share about our travel stories or everything but when it comes to work more or less most people do not do that. And another another thing which you mentioned is that as a developer you're solving something every day I think a lot of people actually miss them I was actually thinking about is that whichever aspect of job we do we are essentially problem solvers right rather than your way of solving problem is by writing code designing on sigma or doing marketing and everything but your main code aspect is solving problems and most people miss this particular part and. If you change that lens on a daily basis you're solving so many problems and you can share that to the world in certain way of your style which can basically help them right. So I think I have read somewhere that you can be a best mentor to someone who is starting but who is one year before you yeah because you are most relevant to the real. There are so many people who are in your position I mean who in position one year before right yeah I think that that is the best thing to to share about that so and that have helped me a lot like because I have whatever problem I face I know there are so many others who are facing this. Yes we always we tend to have doubts that might be my way of solving problem is not good and people like people will say that okay this is a crap and you you are not solving problem in a good way so in that case we might be like a okay I may have made the mistake but I'll improve yeah if you have that attitude then you won't have that important I think Chennai had the question yeah go at Chennai you can unmute yourself if you want to. Yeah I'm a horrible yeah yeah yeah okay so hello hi everyone I just wanted to ask like I'm at a stage of a pressure so I recently graduated and right now I'm just dipping my toes into front time so what I'm trying to understand here is not exactly the idea is but like you mentioned there should be a good UI there should be good well developed read me file so what are some of those parameters on which you are going to be able to do that. So I'm going to do some of the parameters on which the projects are just especially when like somebody is applying for a job I'm not talking about when you are already a developer and doing some side projects but when you're doing it for the purpose of getting a safe and trend roll or maybe even a full stack roll although I believe full stack is a little bit too overwill be for me at this point of time because due to the vastness of the field but especially maybe in the front text your content context can you elaborate a bit more on that. With regards to the project because at the end of the day yeah I do believe that the proper work is important as my interaction on Twitter has deepened with people I have taken this route to not just learn but also build and put it hosted so that I understand but there must be surely some other way of judging those things which are already built and deployed. I think you should check out so you know dribble dribble.com so that you can get good amount of UI inspirations from dribble I have seen so many developers who are not aware of dribble or even if they are aware they are like that is a designer's tool but so most of the time what so even I thought it is a designer. So there are like so you can go there and check out the UI you can copy paste the UI and build your own stuff. In your read me just add just give the credit to that particular dribble shot that this UI is getting I mean the UI installation is from that so in my previous job we I had to develop a dashboard and there were no designer in our office. So I was the one taking care of design and development. So in that phase dribble have helped me a lot because as a developers we are really not good in designing UI right. So what should be the box shadow what should be the colors and where to place elements how how to make them look good plus UX wise where they should be so we are aware of things but not to that level that they should look or impress somebody. So check like search about dashboards and then you will see a number of dashboards from where you can pick one which is most relevant to your use case and then try to build the replica of that that is much better into the code. So basically I need to work on the ability to say there is an existing template trying to convert into HTML CSS and say any other front and text we are using to that that should be that is what should be worked on. Yeah, I mean that has worked for me. I mean if anybody have any other solutions on that that might be even helpful but this has helped me a lot because that will give you the eye of UI as well that how things are there or how we should be building things that will give you the sense of creating components in front and not only converting it to HTML CSS but which button component or which other details of that particular UI. Plus for the read me you can you can just write it down in the easiest way which is I mean which can be understood by any reader. So there is a format for read me but for the UI yes it will have helped me a lot by building any front end. I hope that helps you Chenmeh. Yeah, definitely amazing, amazing. Cool. Anyone have any any any other particular questions feel to go ahead. I guess I've been talking for a very long time. Feel free to ask ahead. There's another interesting thing we probably might do is if you want to share your portfolio probably you can give you feedback directly we can do maybe for one or two if possible. She could give you the feedback on that particular thing if she's okay with that and if you probably want to do that that might directly help you and everyone else to actually showcase what particular thing could actually be good any resume or a portfolio or anything that will there but apart from that, anything else anyone have any other particular questions. Nope cool. Yogi for one. Sorry. I have a question. Yeah, who is it I'm not able to figure out. Yeah, it's more cool. Right. I have a question regarding Haka Thun's. Yeah, go ahead. I have a slide for more than three to four Haka Thun's but my idea was never submitted. I used to give them the full idea like make a diagram for full user flow and the system designs where each and everything but they never accepted my idea and it is like I cannot learn or find out what was the mistake like if I cannot make them understand my idea or my idea was poor. So if you guys can tell me something on this. So, Mukul, just one question. Did you ever try to reach out to them? Maybe sometime later or something or any community lead from them to ask for. I mean later. I never tried. Okay, okay. Well, to be honest, I have never been part of any Haka Thun. So I won't be able to really answer this question but I think. So might be reaching out to some of the developers or some of the team might might help you understand that. But I think in case you have any any answer for this, you can share. I have had I've had a share fair bit of experience with Haka Thun's but never never never similar to this particular thing. I guess mostly there are people who are reachable and since most of Haka Thun's now are becoming online. So there are some representatives Mukul. So, Mukul probably you could start reaching out. I guess one thing that you could probably do is if you are active on let's say any of the social media. You know, be Twitter and if you really want to feedback on the idea just post it out in public that I have this particular idea. There will be some people who will probably do that. And if you let's say if you do not have good amount of fall, let's say you have 10 followers on your Twitter. Try to identify two to three people who you think are good on the tech side and just probably tag them under that particular thing. So that it basically comes into their notice. Okay, so it doesn't matter that you want to just you want ultimately the feedback on the idea doesn't matter from whom it comes from the Haka Thun people are probably from any other expert right. So even if you're not able to reach out, just probably put it out on legend Twitter or anything else and try to seek a feedback on it. I hope that helps Mukul. Cool. How should you have a question, go ahead. Yeah, hi everyone. So yeah, I have known in cash for about six months. So yeah, regarding Haka Thun's I have participated in one hackathon that was SIH. Actually, actually it was back in 2019. So I might team scored the first in a spot in my problem statement. So like I can say I have some fair bit of experience. So if anyone wants to sort of like get feedback on an idea, I will be happy to help. Mukul, that there was your first person to help you. You could probably reach out to her and he could probably help you. You could probably even reach out to me. If that's there, just on DM on Twitter, probably just write to us and we'll probably give you the feedback. Okay. Cool. I mean, I will share my Twitter handle here. So if anyone wants to follow me and DM. Sure, sure. Amazing. We'll go to the Arctic is asking that should be post I maintain it on every other platform. Should it stick to one or how exactly one should probably start? I think there is no issue with posting on many platforms together. If you are posting on I mean if you're writing blog, then make sure you are adding the canonical URL. Because otherwise Google will never read your article and it will get banned as being duplicate. So that just add a canonical tag or search a little bit about cross posting when you're posting about blog. But apart from that, if you're sharing your project, if you're sharing any thought, any idea, any learning, then I think you should post on all the platforms which are available to do. Because I have seen people getting hired through Twitter, which was unimaginable two years back. Right. The Twitter rap example of the shrinkage you gave me a few time back, I think. So, I use who created that but job opportunity in the car. So, I think that is the best place. So, wherever you can just post about and shout about your. Interesting. Probably, I guess we are wearing that bag end of session. I want to circle back to the show casing part once again. Is that a lot of folks here, I don't think so. Mrs. that particular thing that I do not know this particular skill or they're probably lacking at any particular technical aspect or any skill aspect. But most of them do not have this part of how do I increase my area of opportunities and the and since Internet is a place where everyone is shouting, everyone is making a noise to make sure that you are standing apart. And actually making that part of getting yourself represented in the right sense. It becomes even more difficult right in that particular sense. So, if there would have been let's say three or five things as a developer who has a skills, but want to showcase yourself or herself in a certain sense to stand up out from the crowd. What are those three to five things one should do. So, I think number one would be attention to details. So, most of the people create projects like consider even the to do list right. So, what have seen is there is like boxes, plain black boxes and where you can. So, if you can give attention to detail even even the scroll to top button in the bottom will enhance whatever you have. Right. So, give attention to detail that will give you that X factor for every project you are creating second, whatever you are doing just try to be consistent. When I say consistent, I am not saying that you should be posting daily, you should be doing things daily, but at least whatever the threshold you have decided, maybe posting 20 50 in once in 15 days, once in month, be consistent with that. Third, I would say finish something it's okay not to have a very perfect product because nothing will be perfect right. But have a finished projects because that will give anybody the sense of that you are a you are a responsible person, you are not just starting and and throwing things just like that. So, having finished project will give you that X factor for sure. Fourth is start doing networking. You see something good happening appreciate reach out to them doesn't matter if they have 100 following 200 or 100 K. But if you can reach out talk to them every person will give you so much of good ideas and so much of new opportunities. I have seen so many developers who have just 50 60 followers. But who are working in very big organizations and who are like amazing developers. So, yeah and and last thing which we all miss is read others code get have like millions of repose just one randomly and try to read their code what what they are telling you so that might help you a lot. Amazing amazing I guess I guess a lot of people would take away from these points. One last thing before we probably wrap this session is a is that since you're building pure list and a lot of folks here are developers. Could you touch upon this particular part that how peer list probably could help and I know that for a fact I guess a lot of people are here new to pure list and I haven't probably might have not really used it. So, want to share a little bit about what it doesn't how it could help them. When I tried when I was trying to switch jobs and it's a difficult difficult to be a woman in tech. You there is a high possibilities of you being spammed and I know many even many people are getting spam right now that. But and so filled as you said that there is so much of noise and filtering out the signal from that noise is very difficult and that is what we are doing with pure list that if you have proof of work then only you can create your pure list profile with I mean you cannot so when you do a pair create a pure list profile you have to integrate your good. Right so and in it of you have like proof of work. You can integrate your dev to articles your hash for articles if you have a newsletter and subtract you can integrate that so that what we are promoting is that if you have done something then that should get preference over what you are posting your random thoughts your. Your emotional stories over that what you are actually building. So that is the thought process behind pure list and that is where so every developer creating a profile that are really happy because they we got a single platform where they can. Show their GitHub contributions show their projects showcase their articles showcase their resumes and everything they are doing in and around so yeah amazing I have one particular question just start off curiosity. Is that is is is pure list focused around only towards developers or probably to everyone else or is it the focus right now only and developers and as you scale the audience will probably go because I've seen website for a long time and it does have those different different uses for different different for some. Yes so we are so basically when we started we we try to be very focused so because the co founders were so me and Akash Akash is a designer and developer so we were so designer and developer whether to person us which we can really get to the most so we start with that but then we started like scaling it for other people because there are many product managers. Many writers many people who are in sales who want it is there to profile and they don't know how to do it so that is where you are like moving ahead and we have added so many other person as well we have now investors joining in and everybody so yeah. Though it started but now it covers so many other person as well okay okay amazing are now have one particular question I'm thinking of documenting and writing about everything that I will be I'll be doing the exploration period as 18 months 18 year old for the next 365 days what are your views about it and as much too much needs defined. I think not way too much needs defined but I think way too much efforts I'm not sure 365 days how is it possible. I think Flavio cops is the only person who tried doing one article a day and he successfully did it I don't I there might be some many people but the people is him and I guess 200 300. Letter to edit word document is good and if you can do that it's brilliant yeah you could probably try out atomic as is like he said 200 300 that would be a lot more easier to write out and full scale articles. Yeah, I heard some other question for you. Yes, suppose I'm somewhere you know one year of experience in I can industry is beneficial to take external certification or keep building site projects. I built a few site projects in my college days but left you to full time job so depends on so external which external certificates I guess you are doing right I mean if you're going in store if you're going in back then why not it will definitely help you out. So I'm not really sure which external courses you are external certifications you are referring to here but I guess both will help you depending on what what you want to pursue in your career. Cool, first do you have any follow up question on that you can unmute yourself. Yeah, actually I wanted to clarify so like for the skills that are required in my job what what I what work I do presently so for that purpose is taking certification like better or proving it to my current employer through my site project that I am good at this. So I can like get better opportunities and get better projects in my current organization so like out of these two options which one would be like better in terms of efforts that I put in. So which are the certifications that you want to try want to be see not anything in particular so actually in my current role I work on back end web services and like dashboards and everything alert dashboards and everything so for that case like I use some tools but like I'm not sure if taking certification on those tools will be more helpful or. If I could build some sort of script or a module for that will that be more I think one thing you should be checking with is yours with seniors from from the same organization if you are trying to you know get a raise or get a promotion in the same organization that do they have such policies or do they consider that thing that is the first thing you should do before before checking out on anything. Second is there is no harm in doing the site projects as well because those will be helping or base but for the certification you you should be checking what are the advantages of that particular certification in your profession so maybe in be it with the current employer you are with or if you want to switch anytime soon or anytime after after the certification what are the benefits you will be getting from that I think that will be. So maybe deciding point for you to go ahead with certifications or with with the site projects I hope that answers your question yes yes that's that's great. Thank you amazing anyone had anyone else have any particular questions or doubt for you again feel free to go ahead. You're getting any any particular closing note you want to have here for all the folks here. So yeah I mean so all these things like building site projects being active on social media promoting your work keep I mean making proof of work all this is good but this might get overwhelming at times that okay that I'm constantly so I had this. I had this word now because I was constantly so keep this in mind that whatever you're doing you're doing it as a profession so so that that balance you have to maintain and only you can maintain that nobody can give you any suggestion or anything to maintain that. So these give these things will get overwhelming but yeah they are like that only. Yes amazing amazing I guess a lot of okay we have one more question. I want to get started in freelancing could you give me some advice I think for freelancing itself I mean proof of work will be necessary and being active on social media will also be very very necessary so I think Twitter is the best place to get get so many people I mean get noticed by so many people. Make connections there are some platforms as well but I'm really not aware of how good they are in terms of getting the real freelancing projects because when I used to do freelancing it was always through some some mutual connections or through some network with which I have worked for. Being part of communities also I guess helps a lot these days because there are a lot of developers and communities that come where you can get the reference and. Right right yeah okay cool anyone else have any other question. About the freelancing thing I like to add one more point suppose there is any like a specific client that you want to work for like look for their product and like spot up. Find something that you think you can improve on that product and just mail them about it like I hello I checked out your product this is the thing that I've been facing problem it I think I can help you with that so maybe we can get on a meeting and discuss this. That's a way to get more plans and it has like work for me personally. Yeah I would I would suggest this not just only for freelancing but even for jobs and internships I've got this on a personal level where design is and developers have done a very small bit of our product redesigned it or made a small changes is given up. So I think it's a suggestion on one and it doesn't matter what the end result there basically produce but it helps us to really see that the thought process the work that has gone beyond and everything so I guess this is a very good thing if you're really passionate about working at one particular workplace or a company. Yes, I know. Yeah cool anything else anyone want to share ask want to discuss. As we can wind up for the day. Thank you so much you're going to for doing this staying out time on this weekend really really love doing this. This was our first session so this was very special to us so thank you so much probably would like to take a photo if people if you could probably have webcams on now if possible even for a two to three seconds that would be really great. But yeah as many people as there. Thank you so much again love hosting you and I hope you had a great time. Yeah, I would love to do this again sometime with some other things okay and all the best for pureness rooting for you folks. Same here same here in case I mean I read your story yesterday and I'm so glad I mean would love to have another one on one call with you sometime pretty soon. I'm really happy to be the part of this this today session definitely definitely cool thank you so much everyone else also for joining this weekend and we'll see you in the another sessions and have a good day folks have a great weekend.\n"
