There is too much nested condition inside the function and the code is too hard to read for no reason. In this video, I will show you what are the two problems and how we will fix them.The guard closes technique is a way to un-ness everything inside the if condition. The developer that is available is equal to false, so we will say if the developer is available.There is way too much return inside a function. You can remove all the returns inside the function and just keep the last one.The new subscribe function is cleaner and simpler to understand than the old one. It stores the message value inside and can return it anyway.
